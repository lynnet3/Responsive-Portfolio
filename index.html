                Hello, and welcome to my website my name is Emily Tucker. This is page is a portfolio to show the
                different sites i have created both for my 2019 programimg class and for later works. Thank you for
                stopping by below there's just a little more information about me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm origianlly form the Metro Deroit area growing up both on the East side of Deroit and in the Grosse
                Point Woods area. There I started on working on getting an art degree at Macomb Community College. Later
                I moved to North Carolina in 2014 and continued to work towards and art degree changing this to do more
                programing based learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of September of 2019 I am working as a Target Starbucks Barista in Charlotte North Carolina working
                to get back into school to combine the art and the programing aspects of my life. Hopefuly this will
                provide a gateway to get out of the retail busness and find a more stable job. Enjoy your stay on my
                page.
